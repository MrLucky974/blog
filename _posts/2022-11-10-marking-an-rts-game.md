Hello, everyone !
Showing a little bit of my progress so far for a small RTS game I'm making.

![](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bd9c5be789a23d2455ae106deefb8197/bdc30d533f3037a0-3a/s640x960/be0d2c336d87f25d1c9cdab460f476b726c68121.pnj)

Maps will be randomly generated to encourage replayabilty (everything in this game is still in a very early work in progress state, nothing is final).

There's already a [basic grid building system](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEsGu--9P8&list=PLzDRvYVwl53uhO8yhqxcyjDImRjO9W722) to place buildings of different sizes (this one is a 2*2 tiles building), and you can already see that you can't place a building on top of another one.

For the moment being, to build you need to press "B" or click on the pencil button in the bottom left corner, and then click on either the lil plant for a farm or the skull for the barracks. This is, of course, not final, and the UI is very barebones.

All of these cools assets are from the incredible [Kenney](https://href.li/?https://kenney.nl/) and [Kay Lousberg](https://href.li/?https://kaylousberg.com/).

And to conclude this post, here is the tooltip system that will share information to the player.
My goal with this project is to create a simple and affordable RTS style game with some "unique" elements to allow a new experience.

Stay tuned for future updates. ~ Luckius :)
